        <p>I am a passionate videographer, who has experience in creative development, and small production projects. In hopes of becoming a professional videographer and video editor, I've put together my creative work into an online portfolio. Ultimately, my goal is to become a visual storyteller that can produce quality and meaningful content​. ​To improve my professional skills, I'm hoping for more creative opportunities to gain more experience in video production, and to turn ideas into high quality productions that can entertain and inspire people.

        By enrolling in UC Davis Extension's Full Flex Coding Bootcamp program, I hope to add more technical skills to my resume, and utilize what I learn in this course to make myself more marketable in the job market and mix in my creative side as well.
